This course provides an introduction to programming with the Python language. The course material is suitable for complete beginners, with no previous programming experience or knowledge required or assumed.  
The materials are split into broad sections, which we call worksheets, containing exercises for you to try and most of the information that you will need to complete them. You can always get more information on any topic/object type/function etc. by looking at the Python help pages - type `help(object)` in the Python shell to get help on _object_ - or the 'cheat sheet', or by searching online. The online Python documentation (for [version 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2/) or [version 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)), people's previous questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), and a lot of the module homepages are very good places to start.  
If you work through the materials, you will learn:
* the basic concepts and building blocks of programming in Python
* how to quickly automate repetitive tasks and calculations
* the best ways of handling different types of data
* about working with the extensive catalogue of subject-specific modules available for Python
* how to read data from a file, process, and summarise it
* how to visualise data using Python’s powerful plotting libraries

We recommend using the [Anaconda distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) of Python. It's free and comes with a large number of additional modules included ready for importing into your scripts, IPython shell and notebook interfaces, a powerful Python text editor (Spyder), and a good package manager, _conda_, for updating and installing packages.   

The main course workbook (IntroductionToPythonProgramming.ipynb) can be viewed in nbviewer [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tobyhodges/ITPP/blob/master/IntroductionToPythonProgramming.ipynb).  
The other IPython Notebook, WS3exercise.ipynb, is a worked-through solution to the main exercises in worksheet 3 of the workbook. This can be viewed in nbviewer [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tobyhodges/ITPP/blob/v2/WS3exercise.ipynb). If you are taking the course, or working through the materials on your own, try to find your own solution to these exercises, and then use this ipynb if you get stuck, or want to compare your results to ours.
