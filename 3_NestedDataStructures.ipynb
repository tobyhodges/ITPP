You can see the full list of built-in data structures (for Python v3) here: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html. You should also have an idea of the ways that you can repeat actions on lists and dictionaries with `for` loops, as well as take decisions based on data using `if` statements. This knowledge and these skills can be applied to some quite sophisticated programming. "

If you don't take the time to consider the best way to capture, store, and access your data, you can end up writing programs that are much more complicated and error-prone than they need to be. This can cost you a lot more time in the future. As with any project, a little time spent planning at the beginning can save a lot of time later on."

    "Of course, the potential for nested data structures doesn't stop at two-level lists of lists, or lists of dictionaries, or dictionaries of lists, or dictionaries of dictionaries! Depending on the situation, you might want to combine some of the other different structure types (which we don't cover so much here), build up three- or four-level structures, and so on. Be warned, though: with every additional layer, your program becomes more and more complicated. This makes it harder for you to keep track of what you're dealing with while you're writing it, harder to read when you or someone else comes back to the program at a later date, and more difficult to identify and correct mistakes in the code itself."
