    "So far, we’ve had fun playing with commands at the Python Shell prompt, but now we are going to need to start editing programs properly and saving them so that we can change them and re-use parts later.  So, now start the Spyder program (or another text editor of your choice), and open a new file to start writing your code into. There is no prompt like in the Python Shell window, just a space for you to edit you first program. When you finish a line and press enter here, nothing will be executed. Instead, you will need to save and run your script each time you want to execute any changes that you've made. In Spyder, this is easy, as the interface includes a small Python Shell window dedicated to the output of the code that you write in the editor."

Although you can use the command history at the shell prompt to access your previous lines of code, it is often easier to keep your scripting separate from the output. Later, we will see an example of where using an editor is really useful."

Firstly, the `for` statement creates the variable `item` (the variable name can of course be anything that you want), then sets the value to each of the elements in the list.

Python recognises the lines we want to form part of the loop by the level of indentation and it is vital that you maintain consistent indentation throughout your programs. For example, you can choose to indent lines of code with spaces or with tabs but, whichever one you choose, you should only use one or the other for your whole program. Also, make sure that you keep the amount of indentation consistent across all the levels in your code. You will find that this approach makes your programs easier to read and understand, because you can see the structure of the program at a glance by the indentation."

    "Keeping data in parallel arrays like this is fine if you are really really careful and you don’t need to change the arrays that much. Otherwise, it is prone to errors. One way of getting around this (and our last new data type) is to use a _dictionary_. Dictionaries are sort of like lists, but instead of holding just a single value, they hold a key-value pair. So, when you want to look up a value in the dictionary, you specify the key and the dictionary returns the value, rather than just using an index. An example might help: "

Regardless, in the examples and exercises in this course, we assume that this order cannot be relied upon - we don't expect everyone to be using v3.6 or above, and anyway this is not yet considered a 'stable' feature of the language i.e. future versions of Python are not guaranteed to preserve the order of dictionaries.
