    "You now know about the most commonly-used Python data types. There are more, each with characteristics suited to a particular task or situation and, if you like, you can make your own as well. You can see the full list of built-in data structures (for Python v3) here: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html. You should also have an idea of the ways that you can repeat actions on lists and dictionaries with `for` loops, as well as take decisions based on data using `if` statements. This knowledge and these skills can be applied to some quite sophisticated programming. "

    "One other key to writing effective programs is the ability to encapsulate your data and allow them to be accessed and analysed in a way that is efficient and appropriate. If you don't take the time to consider the best way to capture, store, and access your data, you can end up writing programs that are much more complicated and error-prone than they need to be. This can cost you a lot more time in the future. As with any project, a little time spent planning at the beginning can save a lot of time later on."
